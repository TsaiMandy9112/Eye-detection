# Eye-detection
In the current era of technological explosion, the use of electronic products has become an important part of people's daily lives. Whether on the way to work or after coming home from get off work, people often use their phones with their heads down.
As students in the Department of Data Science, our daily lives are closely related to computers. As this trend develops, we find that whether it is the data science department or the current student population,
The proportion of people wearing glasses is gradually increasing. In order to avoid excessive damage to the eyes when using electronic products, we plan to develop a software that can predict eye usage through lens monitoring.
and apply it to mobile phones.
 The main purpose of this software is to provide advance reminders when using computers or mobile phones to help users prevent eye fatigue and vision loss. We designed a detection system that can monitor in real time
The user’s eye condition. The main indicators monitored by the system include the number of glares, ambient brightness and distance from the screen. Monitoring of these indicators can help us understand the user's eye usage and start
Notifications pop up when using electronic products. In addition, we will also remind you again ten minutes before the symptoms are predicted to start, so that users can adjust their eye behavior in time to reduce eye fatigue.
 During the development process, we will focus on data collection and analysis to ensure that the software can accurately predict eye usage. We invited at least twenty test subjects to open the test software when using computers or mobile phones.
body and record their eye use conditions. This data will be fed back to the database and personalized to each person's eye usage. This approach allows us to provide each user with a customized
Predictive analytics to help them better protect their eyes.
 In addition, after each recording is completed, the system will pop up a simple questionnaire for the subjects to fill in to provide feedback on their actual body sensations and eye use conditions. These feedback materials not only help us deepen
Understanding the subject's visual needs can also be incorporated into the analysis model to further improve prediction accuracy. Our goal is to provide each user with more accurate eye reminders by continuously optimizing the model.
The ultimate goal is to prevent the adverse effects of long-term use of electronic products on the eyes.
 In addition to providing eye reminders, we also designed a forced break function. After using it for a certain period of time, the system will automatically control the screen and require the subject to stand up and perform simple exercises, such as jumping jacks.
Or move around. This feature is designed to encourage users to take regular breaks to reduce eye and body fatigue, thereby more comprehensively protecting their health. Our software is not only suitable for data science students;
It is used by the majority of people who frequently use electronic products. Whether they are office workers, students or other people who need to use computers and mobile phones for a long time, they can all benefit from it. With the continuous development of science and technology, electricity
Sub-products will become more popular, so we hope this software can play an important role in protecting eye health, thereby improving their quality of life and work efficiency.
